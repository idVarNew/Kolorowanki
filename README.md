I've always been fascinated by graphics programs, maybe that's why in the past I wanted to be (and I am actually...) a graphic designer, however creating my own program was actually really fun. There was this "WOW" effect, when you pick a brush, select one color and size and you can paint whatever you want! almost like in Paint :)

I thought it will note be easy (I have never used AngularJS before), but in fact it was easy, so I hope one day (when I improve my JavaScript skills) I will create more complex one, like "mini Photoshop" :) however then I am not sure if I use AngularJs, the frameworks changes very quickly, so probably in a few months there will be something "better".
